    <h1>Sol Water Management</h1>
    <p>This is a team of the division Sol Resource Management.</p>
        <i>The woman in the picture carries water in plastic buckets. She is probable to have led a simple life materially,
        but some modern materials, e.g. petroleum, have reached her village. Our use of petroleum is changing the water
        cycles. How are today's children going to enjoy nature?</i></p>
        The amount of water that we could use easily seems to be decreasing. Water seems to be changing how it
        circulates. While its largest cycles change slowly, we witness changes that influence our lives more and more,
        e.g. rivers and lakes have been losing up to 100% of their waters. What have you experienced? Of what changes
        have you heard? Many have been reported through screens.</p>
        Air is the most important element with which water interacts. We have changed them and their interactions, and
        we don't like the costs of these actions. What can we do to lead a good life with enough water?</p>
        Any being would do anything to survive e.g. by ensuring a good <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1271864">water metabolism</a>. One's last resort is to fight
        over water. Microsoft is helping Ukraine manage their data during the war. We want to help people manage water
        so that they avoid going to war.</p>
        Let's agree on what actions to take!</p>
        I'm sharing some thoughts first.</p>
        1. We help people to choose where to spend their years.</p>
        You can ask us to analyse information e.g. about certain countries. While you can choose your residence
        according to many criteria, some of them might be related to natural resources, e.g. water.</p>
        2. Data about water can be managed more usefully.</p>
        Sol Information Management can help people to manage data so that water management improves.</p>
        People consume fresh water e.g. from rivers and from the ground, mainly for agriculture. To the extent that we
        allow e.g. watersheds and wetlands to keep their balance, we can expect water to recycle or renew so that we can
        use some over and over.</p>
        3. You can order with us a benefit-cost analysis that shows which types of water bring most of the benefits you
        want.</p>
        To the extent that you choose bottled water, we can deliver it to you.</p>
        4. The less water is available in a certain region, the more one is pressed to either have trucks deliver water
        in tanks or move to a place with more litres of water per capita available every year.</p>
        We can help make the choice. Then we either deliver water or help you resettle.</p>
        5. You can order with Sol Provider Management products made more sustainably, e.g. during the production of
        which water is managed better.</p>
        Let's discuss whatever topic is related to water management and you find worth your while! We'll agree on how we
        interact to improve some things.</p>
